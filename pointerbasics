// Example program need quick read http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/pointers/
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
int main()
{
  std::cout <<"hello"<<"\n";
  int x = 25;
  int *p;// how you decalare a pointer, remember that each pointer needs its * ie int *p, *y, *c, z; z would just be int
  p = &x;//assigning p to x, p now holds the memory location of x
  std::cout <<"cout p "<< p<< std::endl;// will print the memory location the pointer is pointing to the memory location
  using namespace std;
  cout <<"cout *p "<< *p<<endl;// how to use the actual memory that is stored in the location that it points to
}
